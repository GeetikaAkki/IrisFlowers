# Iris Flowers Classification Project

This project demonstrates the classification of iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its physical dimensions. It covers the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions, correlations, and feature relationships using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Modeling:** Implement multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Present model results and decision boundaries graphically.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To create and share interactive documents.
